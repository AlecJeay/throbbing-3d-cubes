Cubes will spawn on screen, each one is spawned from class and has its own throbbing and moving animations.


Click a cube to send it off in a random direction or just look at it throbbing in all its glory

WSAD and IJKL keys also move two of the cubes, the third is AI controlled just randomly floating around.
